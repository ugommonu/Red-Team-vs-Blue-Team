Overview
For this project, I was tasked to act as an offensive security, Red Team Member, to exploit a vulnerable Capstone VM. I was also tasked to use Kibana to analyze activity logs taken during the Red Team attack. I analyzed these logs, and used the data collected to develop ideas for new alerts that can improve my monitoring as a Blue Team member.
